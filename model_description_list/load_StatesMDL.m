function [StatesMDL] = load_StatesMDL(model_name)
%Load states model description list.
%Columns: 1 - Name
%         2 - Unit
%         3 - 'Plottable' name
%         4 - Description
%         5 - Path to block containing state
%
%   This function dynamically constructs the model description list
%   based on the states found in the model. This is done primarily by
%   comparing the 'path' to the blocks to which each state belongs (defined in column 5). 
%   For blocks containing multiple states, either:
%   - The user can list them individually in a cell column array, and
%     the function will separate them into individual states automatically. 
%     In this case, the number listed states must equal the actual states, and 
%     at least the first column must be defined. For columns 2,3, and 4,
%     the entry must either be a) empty, b) contain one value (which is
%     then copied to all the states), or c) defined as the first column,
%     with an equal number of entries. 
%  -  A single entry can be specified. The function will then copy and
%     number the entry by appending '__##', where ## is the number. Note: 
%     the number of digits in this number is not fixed, and no 0's are added.
%     E.g.: eta__1, eta__2, ..., eta__10, eta__11, ..., eta__100, eta__101
%     This numbering is used only for columns 1 and 3. All other columns
%     are simply copied. 
%  If a state is found which is not defined in this function, it will be
%  automatically assigned a 'generic' name, and numbered according to its
%  position in the full state vector, i.e. 'x__##'
